Idea 1
An instrument utilizing sensors of arduino

Summary
Using arduino, I would like to create an instrument, which in essence works like a piano. Iâ€™d imagine this will work well with buttons that come with arduino kit or create a new way of playing it using other features of it. What would be nice is to have a way of playing sound without actually touching anything at all. One can play music just by moving their hand in mid air. 

Component Parts
Inputs: button, motion sensor (camera)
Output: sound, light, display on screen?



Idea 2
An arduino remote control car

Summary
There are toy cars made from arduino and one that I want to make is something you can control using motion and gesture. There can be a controller that is a  wearable and as you move your body in a certain way it controls where the car is going and its speed.

Component Parts
Input: Motion sensor
Output: motor
