Summary
Using arduino, I would like to create an instrument, which in essence works like a piano. Iâ€™d imagine this will work well with buttons that come with arduino kit or create a new way of playing it using other features of it. 

Component Parts
Inputs: button, motion sensor
Output: sound, light, display on screen?
